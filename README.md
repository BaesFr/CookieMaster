CookieMaster
=============

CookieMaster is designed to be a lighter, faster, prettier and more easily extendable alternative to Cookie Monster.

It is (being) written from scratch and aims to bring rough feature parity with Cookie Monster, while offering nicer visual integration, more speed and flexibility.

New features that I think of will also be incorporated.

How to use
----------

1. Paste the contents of https://github.com/greenc/CookieMaster/blob/master/bookmarklet.js into a bookmark in your browser.
2. Load up Cookie Clicker.
3. Load the recently created bookmark.

What can CookieMaster do?
---------------------------

Not a whole lot yet, as it's still fairly early in development. Here's the checklist so far:

 - Long number shortening. (convert 1,234,567,890 to 1.235 billion)
 - Number localization (numbers formatted to 123,456,789.0 or 123.456.789,0 depending on your preference)
 - Clean up the game window (remove ads, top bar, etc.)
 - Change game font
 - Display accurate countdown timers for game events, e.g. Next golden cookie, remaining time for buffs
 - Play an audio alert and flash the screen when Golden Cookies and Reindeer spawn

And when it's done?
-----------

 - Calculate and display the most effienct purchases and upgrades
 - Calculate and display Heavenly Chip data
 - Calculate and display information regarding banked cookies for maximum buff payouts and other items
 - Pause button
 - Multiple save slots and easy save import/export functionality
 - Higher attainable FPS for more accurate timers without crippling your system!

Yeah so when will that be?
-----------

I'm currently a single developer doing this in my spare time, so updates may be erratic!
