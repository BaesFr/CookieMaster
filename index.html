		<h2>Releases</h2>
		<p>I try to update CookieMaster as often as possible, but I'm currently a single developer doing this in my spare time, so there's no fixed release schedule as such.</p>
		<p>For a full release history, consult the <a href="https://github.com/greenc/CookieMaster/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md">Changelog page</a> on GitHub.</p>

		<h2>Browser Support</h2>
		<p>Extensive browser testing has not yet been carried out, however CookieMaster should work happily in current releases of the following browsers:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Chrome (recommended)</li>
			<li>FireFox</li>
			<li>Safari</li>
			<li>Internet Explorer 10+</li>
		</ul>
		<p>CookieMaster uses some new web features that may not be supported in older browsers.</p>

		<h2>Developers / Contributing</h2>
		<p>CookieMaster uses <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> and <a href="http://gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a> for building and managing the project. Although not necessary for contributing changes, it is recommended to have these installed if you want to take advantage of the project build tasks.</p>
		<p>It is recommended to download and run Cookie Clicker locally for testing any changes you make to the plugin. All Cookie Clicker game assets are static, so just run a <code>wget</code> or your preferred equivalent on <a href="http://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/">http://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/</a> to grab the game files. The CookieMaster source file paths assume that you have Cookie Clicker running in an adjacent directory named <em>/cookieclicker</em>.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Make sure you have <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a>, and optionally <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> and [<a href="http://gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a> installed first.</li>
			<li>Fork the <a href="https://github.com/greenc/CookieMaster">CookieMaster repository on GitHub</a> and clone it to your local machine.</li>
			<li>Make your changes. All source files are located in the <em>src/</em> folder. If you are using Node/Grunt, you can run <code>grunt build</code> to create a <em>build/</em> directory with optimized files for local testing (remember to **only** include <em>src/</em> files in your commits if you issue a pull request).</li>
			<li>When you're done making changes, commit and push them up to your forked repository.</li>
			<li>You may then create a pull request from GitHub if you would like to have your changes considered for inclusion in the main CookieMaster repo.</li>
